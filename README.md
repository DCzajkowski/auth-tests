## Versioning
The version of this package reflects current major version of the Laravel framework. For example:
If Laravel framework has version 5.6, version of this package compatible will be `5.6.*`.

## Installation
```bash
composer require dczajkowski/auth-tests --dev
php artisan make:auth --without-email-verification # if not ran previously
php artisan make:auth-tests
```

Edit `phpunit.xml` file by adding these two lines between `<php>` tags:
```xml
<env name="DB_CONNECTION" value="sqlite"/>
<env name="DB_DATABASE" value=":memory:"/>
```
Alternatively, use different database than sqlite, but also different from the one used for development.

### Using the e-mail verification feature
If you want to use the e-mail verification feature, you will have to make following changes:
- update `routes/web.php`:
```diff
-Auth::routes();
+Auth::routes(['verify' => true]);
```
- update `app/User.php`:
```diff
- class User extends Authenticatable
+ class User extends Authenticatable implements MustVerifyEmail
```

## Options
There are four flags for customizing your tests. You can use any combination of them. (All flags have their short version e.g. `--zonda` or `-z`)
```php
# make:auth-tests
public function testUserCanLogout()
{
    //
}

# make:auth-tests --snake-case
public function test_user_can_logout()
{
    //
}

# make:auth-tests --annotation
/** @test */
public function userCanLogout()
{
    //
}

# make:auth-tests --public
function testUserCanLogout()
{
    //
}

# make:auth-tests --curly
public function testUserCanLogout() {
    //
}

# make:auth-tests -caps # or --zonda
/** @test */
function user_can_logout() {
    //
}
```
Since version 5.7 there has been a new test for email verification added. You can omit it by running `--without-email-verification`.

To review all flags run `php artisan make:auth-tests --help`.

## Updating
To update tests when a new version of this package arrives:
```bash
composer update dczajkowski/auth-tests
php artisan make:auth-tests
```
**Warning! All changes to the files this package provides will be lost when running this command!**

## Automate your workflow
Instead of including this package manually every project you create, simply create a bash function that will do that for you. I have included my personal function [here](https://gist.github.com/DCzajkowski/9ebaeaa09d136e77497e060449b03171). Feel free to edit it and reuse however you like.
